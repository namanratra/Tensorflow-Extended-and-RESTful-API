# Tensorflow-Extended-and-RESTful-API

The file TFX and RESTful API.ipynb contains the complete process of how to build a pipeline in TFX using different components of TFX (ExampleGen, StatisticsGen, ExampleValidator, SchemaGen, Trainer, Pusher etc.) all the components are explained in detail in the notebook and later we automate the pipeline and use RESTful API to fetch the model built in Tensorflow Extended

The data set used in this is the MNIST Fashion data set.
